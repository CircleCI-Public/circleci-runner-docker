# CircleCI runner images

**CircleCI has a new [container runner](https://circleci.com/docs/container-runner) in open preview.**  If you're looking for a way to run jobs in containers similar to how CircleCI Cloud runs jobs with its [Docker executor](https://circleci.com/docs/using-docker), use the container runner.


`circleci/runner` image is created by CircleCI to be with the [runner][] feature.

Currently the `launch-agent` tag can be used to run the launch-agent in a container colocated with the CircleCI job, i.e. the job will run inside the same container.

In the future a variant will be added that runs the `launch-agent` runs on the host and will run each job inside its own container (via the `task-agent`).

## Getting Started

This image can be used on a host with docker installed:

```bash
CIRCLECI_RESOURCE_CLASS=<resource-class> CIRCLECI_API_TOKEN=<runner-token> docker run --env CIRCLECI_API_TOKEN --env CIRCLECI_RESOURCE_CLASS --name <container-name> circleci/runner:launch-agent
```
